"""DIST-LITE-3: Lite WebSocket events server.

Runs as a daemon thread inside the MCP process. Bridges the InProcessQueueSink
(fed by pipeline emit_event() calls) to connected WebSocket clients (graph viewer).

Correctness constraints (all present):
- _server_thread_lock guards start_background() check+spawn as an atomic unit
- loop captured inside _serve() (after asyncio.run() starts it)
- sink.attach_loop(loop) called immediately after capture
- sink.attach_loop(None) called in _serve() finally regardless of exit path
- asyncio.wait_for(sink._q.get(), timeout=1.0) allows stop_event check on idle queue
- return_exceptions=True in asyncio.gather — broken clients never kill broadcast loop
- Thread is daemon=True — exits automatically with the process
- OSError caught in _serve() → log warning, do not re-raise
