"""DIST-LITE-3: Process-singleton InProcessQueueSink for the MCP plugin.

get_event_sink() is called from two threads:
  - main thread (via storage.get_memory())
  - daemon thread (via events_server._serve(), the SSE drain loop)

Double-checked locking ensures exactly one InProcessQueueSink is created.
Without the lock, both threads can race past the ``_sink is None`` check and
produce separate sink instances — the memory singleton and the events server
would then hold different queues, producing no animations.
