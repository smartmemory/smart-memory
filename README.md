SmartMemory is a comprehensive AI memory system that provides persistent, multi-layered memory storage and retrieval for AI applications. It combines graph databases, vector stores, and intelligent processing pipelines to create a unified memory architecture.

## Install

```bash
pip install smartmemory                  # Everything: local memory + MCP server + graph viewer + CLI
pip install smartmemory-core[lite]       # Core library only, local mode (for developers)
pip install smartmemory-core[server]     # Core library only, server mode (FalkorDB + Redis)
```

> **`smartmemory`** is the distribution package. A single install bundles `smartmemory-core[lite]` (local SQLite + usearch storage), the unified MCP server, the graph viewer, and the CLI — there is no separate `[local]` extra. You pick **local** or **remote** mode at `smartmemory setup` time, not at install time.
> **`smartmemory-core`** is the core library for developers building on top of SmartMemory.

## First Run

```bash
smartmemory setup
```

Launches a Textual TUI with arrow-key selection for LLM provider, live model discovery from ollama/lmstudio, embedding provider, and a summary screen. Falls back to text prompts in non-interactive environments (Docker, CI).

**Local mode** wires Claude Code hooks, downloads the spaCy language model (~15MB), and starts a persistent daemon.

**Remote mode** validates your API key and stores it in the OS keychain.

## Quick Start — Local Python API

```python
from smartmemory.tools.factory import create_lite_memory, lite_context

# Simple usage — full LLM extraction runs if OPENAI_API_KEY is set
memory = create_lite_memory()
item_id = memory.ingest("Alice leads Project Atlas")
results = memory.search("who leads Atlas", top_k=5)

# Preferred in scripts — cleans up globals and closes SQLite on exit
with lite_context() as memory:
    item_id = memory.ingest("Alice leads Project Atlas")
    results = memory.search("who leads Atlas")

# Force no LLM calls (even if OPENAI_API_KEY is set)
from smartmemory.pipeline.config import PipelineConfig
memory = create_lite_memory(pipeline_profile=PipelineConfig.lite(llm_enabled=False))
```

## Daemon

SmartMemory runs a persistent background daemon so CLI commands respond in <200ms instead of cold-starting Python every time (~22s).

```bash
smartmemory start       # Start daemon (auto-started by setup)
smartmemory stop        # Stop daemon
smartmemory restart     # Restart daemon
smartmemory status      # Show status, memory count, enrichment queue
```

On macOS, `smartmemory setup` installs a launchd plist — the daemon auto-starts on login and restarts on crash.

### Two-tier ingest

When an LLM API key is available, the daemon runs **two-tier ingestion**:

- **Tier 1 (sync, ~4ms):** spaCy + EntityRuler extracts entities immediately, returns item_id
- **Tier 2 (async, ~740ms):** Background drain thread runs LLM extraction, adds net-new entities and relations

This means `smartmemory add` returns instantly while quality improves in the background.

## Commands

> `sm` is a shorthand alias for `smartmemory` — every command below works with either (`sm add "..."`, `sm search "..."`).

### Core

```bash
smartmemory add "text"                # Add a memory (default type: episodic)
smartmemory add --type semantic "..."  # Add with specific memory type
smartmemory add - < notes.txt          # Add from stdin, one memory per line
smartmemory add --all - < doc.txt      # Add entire stdin as one memory
smartmemory add --project atlas "..."  # Add with arbitrary property flags

smartmemory search "query"             # Semantic search
smartmemory search "*"                 # List all memories
smartmemory search --top-k 20 "query"  # Control result count (default: 5)
smartmemory search --project atlas "q" # Filter by property

smartmemory get <item_id>              # Fetch a single memory by ID
smartmemory retag --content "x" --origin seed:demo --dry-run  # Re-tag matched items' origin
smartmemory recall                     # Session context for Claude Code hooks
smartmemory recall --cwd /path         # Recall with working directory context
smartmemory viewer                     # Open knowledge graph viewer in browser
smartmemory viewer --port 8080         # Custom port for viewer
smartmemory models                     # List available LLM models
smartmemory config                     # View all settings
smartmemory config llm_provider        # View one setting
smartmemory config llm_provider groq   # Change a setting
smartmemory clear                      # Delete all memories and reset vectors
```

### Daemon

```bash
smartmemory start                      # Start daemon + enrichment workers
smartmemory stop                       # Stop daemon
smartmemory restart                    # Restart daemon
smartmemory status                     # Daemon health + enrichment stats
smartmemory worker                     # Run enrichment worker (drain and exit)
smartmemory worker --loop              # Run enrichment worker continuously
```

### Setup & Lifecycle

```bash
smartmemory setup                      # Interactive first-run questionnaire
smartmemory setup --mode local         # Skip questionnaire, set local mode
smartmemory setup --mode remote --api-key sk_...  # Non-interactive remote setup
smartmemory setup --for cursor         # Configure for Cursor instead of Claude Code
smartmemory server                     # Start MCP server (called by MCP clients)
smartmemory uninstall                  # Remove hooks, skills, plist, and data
smartmemory uninstall --keep-data      # Remove hooks/plist but keep memories
```

### Admin

```bash
smartmemory admin export out.jsonl     # Export memories to corpus JSONL
smartmemory admin import data.jsonl    # Import corpus JSONL into SmartMemory
smartmemory admin reindex              # Re-embed all memories with current model
smartmemory admin reextract            # Re-run entity extraction on all memories
smartmemory admin list-packs           # List available seed packs
smartmemory admin install-pack NAME    # Install a seed pack
smartmemory admin mine                 # Mine Wikidata entities via SPARQL
smartmemory admin convert-rebel        # Convert REBEL dataset to corpus JSONL
```

### Code Indexing & MCP

```bash
smartmemory code index <path>          # Index a code repo (AST entities + call graph) into memory
smartmemory mcp install claude         # Write MCP server config for a client (claude, cursor, codex, ...)
```

### Lifecycle (hook-driven)

These are invoked automatically by the Claude Code hooks that `smartmemory setup` installs — you rarely call them by hand.

```bash
smartmemory lifecycle orient           # Recall context at session start
smartmemory lifecycle recall           # Inject prompt-relevant context
smartmemory lifecycle observe          # Capture a tool call
smartmemory lifecycle distill          # Pair a response with its stored prompt
smartmemory lifecycle learn            # Capture an error pattern
smartmemory lifecycle persist          # Save a session summary
smartmemory lifecycle status           # Show lifecycle config and session stats
```

## Architecture Overview

SmartMemory implements a multi-layered memory architecture:

### Core Components

- **SmartMemory**: Main unified memory interface (`smartmemory.smart_memory.SmartMemory`)
- **SmartGraph**: Graph database backend using FalkorDB for relationship storage
- **Memory Types**: Specialized memory stores for different data types
- **Pipeline Stages**: Processing stages for ingestion, enrichment, and evolution
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom evolvers and enrichers

### Memory Types

- **Pending Memory**: Short-term buffer for items awaiting consolidation (formerly "working"; routed at ingest by the `ConsolidationRouter`)
- **Semantic Memory**: Facts and concepts with vector embeddings
- **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences and learning history
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills, strategies, and learned patterns
- **Zettelkasten Memory**: Bidirectional note-taking system with AI-powered knowledge discovery
- **Reasoning Memory**: Chain-of-thought traces capturing "why" decisions were made (System 2)
- **Opinion Memory**: Beliefs with confidence scores, reinforced or contradicted over time
- **Observation Memory**: Synthesized entity summaries from scattered facts
- **Decision Memory**: First-class decisions with confidence tracking, provenance chains, and lifecycle management. Now structured: `rejected_alternatives`, `rationale`, `constraints`. Capture: `mem.add_decision(...)`.
- **Constraint Memory**: Hard rules — discovered or imposed. Capture: `mem.add_constraint(...)`.
- **Learned Memory**: Lessons learned the hard way. Capture: `mem.add_learning(...)`.

> **Expertise vs knowledge.** The five core types above (Pending/Semantic/Episodic/Procedural/Zettelkasten) plus Reasoning are best read as the **knowledge layer** — what's *true*. Decision/Constraint/Learned/Opinion/Observation form the **expertise layer** — what to *do*, and what *not* to do. The expertise layer is what makes an agent's memory useful for *acting*: captured choices, rejected alternatives, hard constraints, lessons learned. Recall partitioned by expertise type via `mem.search(query, expertise=True)`. See [Expertise vs Knowledge](https://docs.smartmemory.ai/smartmemory/concepts/expertise-vs-knowledge) for the full mapping.

### Storage Backends

- **Lite mode**: SQLite graph + usearch vectors — no Docker, no external services
- **Server mode**: FalkorDB (graph + vectors) + Redis (caching) — full-featured, requires Docker

### Processing Pipeline

`ingest()` runs an 11-stage pipeline:

```
classify -> coreference -> simplify -> entity_ruler -> llm_extract -> ontology_constrain -> store -> link -> enrich -> ground -> evolve
```

Each stage implements the `StageCommand` protocol (`execute(state, config) -> state`, `undo(state) -> state`). The pipeline supports breakpoint execution (`run_to()`, `run_from()`, `undo_to()`) for debugging and resumption.

`add()` is simple storage: normalize -> store -> embed (use for internal/derived items).

## Key Features

- **11 Curated Memory Types**: Pending, Semantic, Episodic, Procedural, Zettelkasten, Reasoning, Opinion, Observation, Decision, Constraint, Learned (plus structural types like `code`, `plan`, `evaluation`, `anchor`, and `tool_call` used internally)
- **11-Stage NLP Pipeline**: classify -> coreference -> simplify -> entity_ruler -> llm_extract -> ontology_constrain -> store -> link -> enrich -> ground -> evolve
- **Self-Learning EntityRuler**: Pattern-matching NER that improves with use — LLM discoveries feed back into rules (96.9% entity F1 at 4ms)
- **Evolver Framework**: Core auto-registered evolvers plus specialist lifecycle evolvers for decay, consolidation, opinion synthesis, retrieval-based strengthening, Hebbian co-retrieval, and stale memory detection
- **Code Indexer**: AST-based Python + TypeScript parser with cross-file call resolution, semantic code search, and memory-to-code graph bridging
- **Zero-Infra Lite Mode**: SQLite + usearch backend — `pip install smartmemory` and go
- **Server Mode**: FalkorDB graph + Redis caching for production-scale deployments
- **Hybrid Search**: Graph-structured search + BM25/embedding RRF fusion with query decomposition for compound queries
- **Auto-Registered Plugins**: 6 enrichers, 9 evolvers, 1 grounder, and 3–5 extractors (3 always loaded + spaCy and GLiNER2 when their optional deps are installed) — plus a larger lazy catalog of ~40 evolvers selectable in Studio
- **Plugin Security**: Sandboxing, permissions, and resource limits for safe plugin execution
- **Flexible Scoping**: Optional `ScopeProvider` for multi-tenancy or unrestricted OSS usage
- **Persistent Daemon**: Background process for <200ms CLI response times
- **Two-Tier Ingestion**: Instant spaCy extraction + async LLM enrichment
- **MCP Server**: Works with Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools
- **Knowledge Graph Viewer**: Interactive browser-based graph visualization

## Memory Evolution

SmartMemory includes built-in evolvers that automatically transform memories. In lite mode, evolution runs incrementally in the background.

### Available Evolvers

**Core evolvers** — memory type transitions and lifecycle:
- **EpisodicToSemanticEvolver**: Promotes stable facts to semantic memory
- **EpisodicToZettelEvolver**: Converts episodic events to Zettelkasten notes
- **EpisodicDecayEvolver**: Archives old episodic memories
- **SemanticDecayEvolver**: Prunes low-relevance semantic facts
- **ZettelPruneEvolver**: Merges duplicate or low-quality notes
- **DecisionConfidenceEvolver**: Decays confidence on stale decisions, auto-retracts below threshold
- **OpinionSynthesisEvolver**: Synthesizes opinions from accumulated observations
- **ObservationSynthesisEvolver**: Creates entity summaries from scattered facts
- **OpinionReinforcementEvolver**: Adjusts opinion confidence based on new evidence
- **StaleMemoryEvolver**: Flags memories as stale when referenced source code changes

**Enhanced evolvers** — neuroscience-inspired dynamics:
- **ExponentialDecayEvolver**: Time-based activation decay with configurable half-life
- **RetrievalBasedStrengtheningEvolver**: Memories accessed more frequently become harder to forget
- **HebbianCoRetrievalEvolver**: Reinforces edges between memories retrieved together ("neurons that fire together wire together")
- **InterferenceBasedConsolidationEvolver**: Similar competing memories interfere, strengthening the dominant one
- **EnhancedWorkingToEpisodicEvolver**: Context-aware pending→episodic transition with richer metadata

**Sleep-cycle & agent evolvers** — opt-in background re-derivation (REM/NREM analogs):
- **MemoryConsolidationEvolver**: Re-derives consolidated memories across an entity's scattered facts during an idle "sleep cycle"
- **TemporalAgingEvolver**: Rewrites future/planned facts into resolved past tense once their date passes ("going to Singapore in July" → "went to Singapore in July 2026") via reversible bi-temporal supersession — triggered by the passage of time, never re-parsing prose
- **EvaluationEvolver**: Writes evidence-derived per-`(agent, dimension, domain)` performance scores via bi-temporal supersession; read back with `get_evaluation()` / `list_evaluation_history()`
- **SemanticToProceduralEvolver** / **ProceduralReinforcementEvolver** / **AnchorReconciliationEvolver**: procedural promotion, usage-based strengthening, and spec-anchor drift reconciliation

**Replaced by ConsolidationRouter (CORE-MEMORY-DYNAMICS-1 M1):**
- The former `WorkingToEpisodicEvolver` and `WorkingToProceduralEvolver` were retired. Routing from the `pending` bucket to `episodic` / `procedural` now happens at ingest time via the `ConsolidationRouter` pipeline stage.

## Plugin System

SmartMemory features a unified, extensible plugin architecture. All plugins follow a consistent class-based pattern.

### Built-in Plugins

**Auto-registered by default** (loaded by `PluginManager._load_builtin_plugins`):
- **Extractors**: `LLMExtractor`, `LLMSingleExtractor`, `ConversationAwareLLMExtractor` (always), plus `SpacyExtractor` and `GLiNER2Extractor` when their optional deps are importable
- **6 Enrichers**: `BasicEnricher`, `LinkExpansionEnricher`, `SentimentEnricher`, `TemporalEnricher`, `ExtractSkillsToolsEnricher`, `TopicEnricher`
- **9 Evolvers**: `EpisodicToSemanticEvolver`, `EpisodicDecayEvolver`, `SemanticDecayEvolver`, `EpisodicToZettelEvolver`, `ZettelPruneEvolver`, `ExponentialDecayEvolver`, `InterferenceBasedConsolidationEvolver`, `RetrievalBasedStrengtheningEvolver`, `EvaluationEvolver`
- **1 Grounder**: `WikipediaGrounder`

**Specialist plugins** (selected by pipeline stage, opt-in feature, or the Studio evolver catalog — not auto-run in the idle cycle):
- **Extractors**: `GroqExtractor`, `DecisionExtractor`, `ReasoningExtractor`
- **Enrichers**: `UsageTrackingEnricher`
- **Evolvers**: `DecisionConfidenceEvolver`, `OpinionSynthesisEvolver`, `ObservationSynthesisEvolver`, `OpinionReinforcementEvolver`, `StaleMemoryEvolver`, `HebbianCoRetrievalEvolver`, `MemoryConsolidationEvolver`, `TemporalAgingEvolver`, `SemanticToProceduralEvolver`, `ProceduralReinforcementEvolver`, `AnchorReconciliationEvolver`
- **Grounders**: `PublicKnowledgeGrounder` (Wikidata QIDs)

> Two registries coexist by design: a small **eager, auto-run** set (above) that runs in the idle/batch evolution cycle, and a **lazy catalog of ~40 evolvers** (`evolution/registry.py`) that Studio can select into workflow DAGs without importing every class at boot. Auto-run ⊆ catalog is an enforced invariant.

### Creating Custom Plugins

```python
from smartmemory.plugins.base import EnricherPlugin, PluginMetadata

class MyCustomEnricher(EnricherPlugin):
    @classmethod
    def metadata(cls):
        return PluginMetadata(
            name="my_enricher",
            version="1.0.0",
            author="Your Name",
            description="My custom enricher",
            plugin_type="enricher",
            dependencies=["some-lib>=1.0.0"],
            security_profile="standard",
            requires_network=False,
            requires_llm=False
        )
    
    def enrich(self, item, node_ids=None):
        item.metadata["custom_field"] = "value"
        return item.metadata
```

### Publishing Plugins

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."smartmemory.plugins.enrichers"]
my_enricher = "my_package:MyCustomEnricher"
```

```bash
pip install my-smartmemory-plugin
# Automatically discovered and loaded!
```

## Non-interactive / CI

```bash
# Local
SMARTMEMORY_MODE=local smartmemory server

# Remote
SMARTMEMORY_MODE=remote SMARTMEMORY_API_KEY=sk_... smartmemory server
```

Env vars always override config file — the correct path for Docker and CI. The TUI is automatically disabled in non-interactive environments.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/smartmemory/config.toml` (XDG on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%\smartmemory\config.toml` on Windows).

API keys are stored in the OS keychain, never in the config file. Set `SMARTMEMORY_API_KEY` as an env var on headless systems where the keychain is unavailable.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SMARTMEMORY_MODE` | `local` or `remote` — overrides config file |
| `SMARTMEMORY_API_KEY` | API key for remote mode — bypasses keychain |
| `SMARTMEMORY_API_URL` | Remote API URL (default: `https://api.smartmemory.ai`) |
| `SMARTMEMORY_TEAM_ID` | Team/workspace ID for remote mode |
| `SMARTMEMORY_DATA_DIR` | Local data directory (default: `~/.smartmemory`) |
| `SMARTMEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER` | LLM provider for local enrichment |
| `SMARTMEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | Embedding provider (`local`, `openai`, `ollama`) |
| `SMARTMEMORY_DAEMON_PORT` | Daemon port (default: `9014`) |
| `SMARTMEMORY_ASYNC_ENRICHMENT` | Enable/disable background enrichment |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for embeddings and LLM extraction |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key — alternative to OpenAI for LLM extraction |
